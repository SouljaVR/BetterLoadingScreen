### Exactly what it says it is

Replaces the default VRChat world loading screen with the original warp tunnel!

This version has compatibility with mods/clients that replace the loading screen music with something else. So just to be clear, this mod itself doesnt allow for custom music. It just offers compatibility with other mods that do. Enjoy :)

Original mod by Grummus.

**USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK. Modding the client is against VRChat ToS. I am not responsible for any bans or other punishments you may get by using this mod!**
